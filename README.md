This is literally the first paragraph on the wikipedia link, what an ignorant idiot

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an Islamic absolute monarchy in which Sunni Islam is the official state religion based on firm Sharia law. Non-Muslims must practice their religion in private and are vulnerable to discrimination and deportation.[1] It has been stated that no law requires all citizens to be Muslim,[1] but also that non-Muslims are not allowed to have Saudi citizenship.[2] Children born to Muslim fathers are by law deemed Muslim, and conversion from Islam to another religion is considered apostasy and punishable by death.[1] Blasphemy against Sunni Islam is also punishable by death
